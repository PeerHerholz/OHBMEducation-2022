To set up your regression model to calculate Cohen's D effect sizes for case/control differences between brain volumes, you will need to edit the input to the following notebook:
        mass_uv_regr_loop_OHBM_simplified.Rmd
        
We will go through this step by step in the course.

We will also plot histograms of the data for each site in the notebook:
         demog_groupStats_loop_OHBM.Rmd
         
You will have the option of expanding these notebooks for future work.
